Backend Polling System
Overview
The Backend Polling System is a web application designed to allow users to create polls, vote on them, and view results in real time. This system is built with a RESTful API to handle poll creation, voting, and result retrieval. It allows multiple users to participate in polls asynchronously and securely.

Features
Create Polls: Users can create polls with multiple options.
Vote on Polls: Users can vote on available options in each poll.
View Poll Results: Users can view the aggregated results of a poll after voting.
Authentication: User authentication to ensure secure access to poll creation and voting.
Real-Time Updates: Poll results are updated in real time for all users viewing the poll.
Persistent Data: Polls, votes, and results are stored in a PostgreSQL database for long-term persistence.

Technologies Used
Backend Framework: Node.js with Express
Database: PostgreSQL
Real-Time Updates: Socket.IO for real-time data updates
Environment Management: dotenv for managing environment variables
Testing: Mocha/Chai for unit testing
ORM: Sequelize (or another ORM of your choice for PostgreSQL)

Installation

Technologies Used
Backend Framework: Node.js with Express
Database: PostgreSQL
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication
Real-Time Updates: Socket.IO for real-time data updates
Environment Management: dotenv for managing environment variables
Testing: Mocha/Chai for unit testing
ORM: Sequelize (or another ORM of your choice for PostgreSQL)
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/backend-polling-system.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy
cd backend-polling-system
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Set up PostgreSQL:

Install PostgreSQL on your machine or set up a PostgreSQL database on your cloud provider.
Create a database for the polling system (e.g., polling_system).
Create a .env file in the root of the project and add your environment variables. For example:

makefile
Copy
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your-db-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
DB_NAME=polling_system
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
PORT=5000
Set up the database schema using Sequelize (or your preferred method for defining PostgreSQL schema):

bash
Copy
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
Start the server:

bash
Copy
npm start
The backend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

API Endpoints
1. Create a Poll
Endpoint: POST /api/polls
Request Body:

  "message": "Poll created successfully",
  "pollId": "123456789"
}
2. Vote on a Poll
Endpoint: POST /api/polls/:pollId/vote
Request Body:
json
Copy
{
  "optionIndex": 1
}
Response:
json
Copy
{
  "message": "Vote recorded successfully"
}
3. Get Poll Results
Endpoint: GET /api/polls/:pollId/results
Response:
json
Copy
{
  "question": "What is your favorite programming language?",
  "options": [
    { "option": "JavaScript", "votes": 10 },
    { "option": "Python", "votes": 5 },
    { "option": "Java", "votes": 3 },
    { "option": "C++", "votes": 2 }
  ]
}

Real-Time Updates with Socket.IO
The backend utilizes Socket.IO to emit real-time updates when a vote is cast or a poll result changes. The frontend can listen to these updates and immediately reflect the changes to the user interface.

Example:
Event: voteCast
Data: { pollId: "123456", optionIndex: 1 }
Trigger: When a vote is cast, the system emits this event to all connected clients.

Deployment
Set up a production environment with a PostgreSQL database and proper credentials.
Deploy the backend to your preferred platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).
Ensure the database is properly connected to the production environment.
